Subject: [PATCH] Apply nord-theme

*"Inspired by the beauty of the arctic, the colors reflect the cold, yet
harmonious world of ice and the colorfulness of the Aurora Borealis."* - [Nord
Theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/)

There are also many [ports](https://www.nordtheme.com/ports) for other programs
like [vim](https://www.nordtheme.com/ports/vim) and
[tmux](https://www.nordtheme.com/ports/tmux) to make the overall appearance
coherent. I would recommend to use it in combination with the arc-theme for gtk
(fits perfectly).

The default behaviour of st is to reverse the fore- and background colors of
each selected cell. If you want that the selection-colors are not reveresed but
instead have fixed fore- and background colors apply on top of this patch the
[selectioncolors](../selectioncolors/)-patch. Then set the following settings
in your config.h:

static unsigned int defaultcs = 257;
static unsigned int defaultrcs = 257;
unsigned int selectionfg = 257;
unsigned int selectionbg = 0;
