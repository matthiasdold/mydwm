# General Idea
This repo is ment as notes for myself as of how to setup my dwm rice

## Base components
* dwm raw
* dwm blocks
* patches as specified below

# Git Management
Follow [this idea](https://dwm.suckless.org/customisation/patches_in_git/)


# Patches and reasons why
* [Vanitygaps](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/vanitygaps/dwm-cfacts-vanitygaps-6.2_combo.diff) -> eye candy for gaps and included cfacts for better resizing
* [status2d](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/status2d/) -> all patches to work without any extra tool / program for status
* [xrdb](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/xrdb/dwm-xrdb-6.2.diff) -> xrdb colors, also used within status2d
* [statusallmons](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statusallmons/dwm-statusallmons-6.2.diff) -> statusbar on all monitors
* [alpha](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/alpha/dwm-alpha-20201019-61bb8b2.diff) -> Transparency in bar
* [setstatus](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/setstatus/dwm-setstatus-6.2.diff) -> simpler syntax for setting the status bar


# TODO
*
* Clickable statusbar --> something with [this](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/statuscmd/)
